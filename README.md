## Projects

### Production & Operations Analytics

#### Global Supply Chain & Procurement Intelligence (End-to-End Analytics)| Python, Tableau | 2025

Built an end-to-end procurement analytics stack by designing and generating a robust, 9,750-row synthetic dataset (orders, suppliers, lead times, defects, costs, and risk scores). The synthetic data was structurally modeled to mirror the high-complexity, low-volume supply chain of heavy equipment manufacturing.

- Engineered core procurement KPIs: On-Time, In-Full (OTIF), Cost of Poor Quality (COPQ $), and a CR5 supplier concentration metric to measure sourcing risk.
  - ![GitHub Repository](https://github.com/andrea-lopera/Procurement-Intelligence-Dashboard-main.git)   
- Developed Tableau dashboards (Executive Overview, Supplier Performance, Risk & Geo) with Pareto, Top-5, trend, and geographic views.
- Identified key cost drivers by tracing defect trends back to specific supplier process variation and highlighted bottlenecks using lead-time variability analysis.

#### Manufacturing Operations Control & Downtime Root Cause Analysis|Python, SQL, Tableau| 2025  
An end-to-end analytics solution to track KPIs, root causes of downtime, and rework in a simulated manufacturing line.  
- Built SQL queries and Python scripts to preprocess operations data  
- Designed a Tableau dashboard to visualize trends and highlight bottlenecks  
- Emphasized decision support for production managers and process engineers

#### Used Car Price Prediction | Regression Models, Python | 2023  
Built and evaluated nine machine learning models to estimate used car prices with over 90% accuracy.  
- Combined regression (Linear, Ridge, Lasso) with tree-based methods (RF, KNN)  
- Enhanced model performance using feature engineering and external datasets  
- Proposed XGBoost-based strategy to improve real-time predictive accuracy

### Geospatial & Public Sector Analytics

#### Mapping Water Bodies for Drought Relief | Python, Power BI, Folium | 2025  
Created a geospatial analytics tool to support drought response using NASA & USGS satellite data.  
- Mapped nearby water sources to drought regions using spatial joins and clustering  
- Delivered insights via Power BI dashboards and interactive Folium maps  
- Empowered environmental planners with data-driven visibility into critical areas

### AI & Computer Vision

#### Facial Recognition System | PCA, LDA, Python | 2024  
Built a facial recognition system using classical techniques (Eigenfaces, PCA/LDA).  
- Applied transfer learning, face alignment, and reconstruction evaluation  
- Improved classification accuracy by 43.7% over the baseline  
- Combined dimensionality reduction and clustering to optimize predictions

#### Image Classification with CNNs | ResNet-18, PyTorch, Transfer Learning | 2024  
Trained deep learning models from scratch and via transfer learning.  
- Achieved 93.4% accuracy with fine-tuned ResNet  
- Used PyTorch Lightning for reproducibility and early stopping  
- Documented results with metric analysis and visual tracking
