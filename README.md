## Projects

### Production & Operations Analytics

#### Procurement Intelligence Dashboard | Python, Tableau | 2025

Built an end-to-end procurement analytics stack by designing and generating a 9,750-row synthetic dataset in Python (orders, suppliers, lead times, defects, costs, and risk scores).

- Engineered KPIs (OTIF, Defect %, COPQ $, CR5, “Suppliers to 80%”) and feature-engineered risk scoring.
- Developed Tableau dashboards (Executive Overview, Supplier Performance, Risk & Geo) with Pareto, Top-5, trend, and geographic views.
- Identified cost drivers and bottlenecks through defect trend analysis and lead-time variability, delivering executive-ready insights.

#### Production Line Intelligence Dashboard | Tableau, Python, SQL | 2025  
An end-to-end analytics solution to track KPIs, root causes of downtime, and rework in a simulated manufacturing line.  
- Built SQL queries and Python scripts to preprocess operations data  
- Designed a Tableau dashboard to visualize trends and highlight bottlenecks  
- Emphasized decision support for production managers and process engineers

#### Used Car Price Prediction | Regression Models, Python | 2023  
Built and evaluated nine machine learning models to estimate used car prices with over 90% accuracy.  
- Combined regression (Linear, Ridge, Lasso) with tree-based methods (RF, KNN)  
- Enhanced model performance using feature engineering and external datasets  
- Proposed XGBoost-based strategy to improve real-time predictive accuracy
